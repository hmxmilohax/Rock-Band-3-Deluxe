how to handle key upgrades:

dta:
-ranks go in songs_upgrades, merge with another upgrade dta array if it exists
-song info (pans/vols/cores) in song update
-extra authoring disc update in song update
-version 30 in song update

mogg:
-straight up copy this to song update

midi:
-key tracks in songs_upgrades, venue track in song update
-key track (pro E) to go in twice, like RBHP does?
