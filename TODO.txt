TODO: 

-split dta into multiple sections in a dta folder, and merge as necessary in each action build
-two new folders: dev_scripts and user_scripts
-rework key integration for key build so it's done explicitly in actions instead of toggle scripts
-refactor every other script that jnack moved so they'll still work in their new folder location
